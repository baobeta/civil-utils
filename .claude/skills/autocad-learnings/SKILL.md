description: Append-only log of newly verified AutoCAD / Civil 3D API gotchas. Use when you discover API behavior (error, signature, version difference) not already documented in the autocad-api, civil3d-api or autocad-scaffold skills, and record it here.

> Upstream: ADN-DevTech/acad-api-skill `skills/learnings.md` @ `1134159` (MIT). Upstream facts are verified for AutoCAD/Civil 3D **2027 / .NET 10**; this repo targets **Civil 3D 2021 (R24.0, net48)**. Where they conflict, the overrides in the root `CLAUDE.md` win. Cross-references to `autocad-api.md`, `civil3d-api.md`, `scaffold.md` mean the `autocad-api`, `civil3d-api`, `autocad-scaffold` skills.

# Learnings Log — AutoCAD / Civil 3D / Plant 3D

Append-only knowledge accumulation file. The AI records verified discoveries here during development sessions. **Never delete entries** — only append new ones or mark existing ones as promoted.

## How this works

1. During a development session, the AI encounters a new gotcha, API behavior, or corrected pattern that is **not already documented** in the skill files.
2. The AI appends it here with today's date, category, and a brief description.
3. A human reviews the entry, verifies it against SDK docs or runtime behavior.
4. Once verified, the entry is **promoted** — moved into the appropriate skill file (`autocad-api.md`, `civil3d-api.md`, `plant3d-api.md`, or `scaffold.md`) and marked below with `Promoted to:`.

## Entry format

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] Category — Short title
- What was discovered (exact API behavior, error message, correct usage)
- Why it matters (what breaks if you get it wrong)
- Source: how it was verified (SDK sample path, runtime test, official docs URL)
- Promoted to: *(pending)* or `skill-file.md` > Section Name
```
